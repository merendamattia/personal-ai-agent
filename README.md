## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_MODEL must be defined in .env"**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains both variables
- Check that the file is in the project root directory

**"Connection timeout"**
- Verify your internet connection
- Check OpenAI API status at [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait a moment before retrying
- Consider using a model with lower costs like `gpt-3.5-turbo`
