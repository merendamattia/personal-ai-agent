Hi [Recipient Name],

I wanted to reach out with a quick update about our project. We've moved up the completion deadline, so we'll need to focus on getting our deliverables ready sooner rather than later. Would you be available to touch base this week so we can align on next steps?

Looking forward to working together on this!
